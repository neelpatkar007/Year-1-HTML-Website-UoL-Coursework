TechCon Event Website - Coursework Project

For this coursework project, I designed and developed a dynamic website for a fictional tech conference, TechCon, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website features several key pages and functionalities:

Registration Page: Facilitates user registration via Google, Facebook, or Twitter accounts, streamlining the sign-up process.
Schedule Page: Displays the event schedule, enabling attendees to easily view and plan their visit.
Speakers Page: Lists the event's speakers along with their bios and session details, providing insight into the conference lineup.
Contact Us Page: Includes a contact form and relevant information for attendees to reach out with questions or feedback.
In addition to the website development, I completed two separate shell scripting tasks:

Shell Script Exercise 1: Outputs a message indicating the script is running, displays the current user, and shows the current working directory.

Shell Script Exercise 2: Prompts the user for a password and checks it against a predefined valid password, providing access or denial based on the input.

These tasks demonstrate my proficiency in shell scripting for system automation and management. The website project highlights my skills in front-end development and creating interactive, user-friendly web interfaces.
